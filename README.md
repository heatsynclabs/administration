Issues
------

Lines of the bylaws that have issues with things like clarity, typos, don't jive with the current organizations practices, are morally in question, etc. can be brought up in the issues section and discussed.  Issue fixes can be pulled in when voted upon by the board as per the amendment section in our bylaws.  Ideally, if there are multiple line changes and have solutions submit them as a group to the board to ease the process.
